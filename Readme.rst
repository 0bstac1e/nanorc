***************************************
Improved Nano Syntax Highlighting Files
***************************************

This repository holds {lang}.nanorc files that have improved 
definitions of syntax highlighting for various languages.
These should be placed inside of the ``~/.nano/`` directory.

Once there you should add the languages you want to your
nano configuration file ``~/.nanorc``.  For example::

    ## C/C++
    include "~/.nano/c.nanorc"

You can also copy the contents of ``import.nanorc`` into your
``~/.nanorc`` to include all languages.
